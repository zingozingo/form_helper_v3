# Business Registration Assistant - Basic Extension

This is a basic, reliable implementation of the Business Registration Assistant Chrome extension. It focuses on core functionality with a clean, straightforward implementation.

## Features

- Detects business registration forms on websites
- Displays detection results in the extension popup
- Identifies the state for the registration form when possible
- Shows detection confidence score
- Simple user interface with no complex features
- Comprehensive debugging support

## Installation

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle in the top-right corner
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `basic_extension` directory
4. The extension is now installed and ready to use

## How It Works

1. The extension automatically scans web pages for business registration form patterns
2. It analyzes URLs, page content, and form elements to determine if it's a registration form
3. When a form is detected, the extension icon will display a checkmark
4. Click the extension icon to see details about the detected form
5. The popup displays:
   - Detection status
   - State (if identified)
   - Confidence score

## Files

- `manifest.json`: Extension configuration with minimal permissions
- `content.js`: Content script that analyzes pages for business registration forms
- `background.js`: Background service worker that manages detection state
- `popup.html/js`: Simple popup UI for displaying detection results

## Testing

To test this extension:
1. Navigate to a business registration form (like a state's LLC formation page)
2. The extension icon should show a checkmark if a form is detected
3. Click the icon to see details about the detection
4. Use "Check Again" to re-analyze the current page

## Icons

You need to add icons to the `icons` directory:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

You can reuse icons from the original extension or create new ones.

## Implementation Notes

This extension was built with several key principles in mind:

1. **Reliability**: Error handling throughout all scripts
2. **Simplicity**: Minimal dependencies and straightforward code
3. **Debugging**: Extensive logging and debug panel
4. **Performance**: Efficient detection algorithms
5. **Clarity**: Clear separation of concerns between components

The content script includes comprehensive logging that can be helpful for troubleshooting. Look for log messages prefixed with `[BRA]` in the browser console.
