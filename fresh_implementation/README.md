# Business Registration Assistant - Fresh Implementation

This is a simplified rebuild of the Business Registration Assistant Chrome extension. It focuses on core functionality with a clean, reliable implementation.

## Features

- Business registration form detection on government websites
- Simple popup showing detection status and confidence score
- State identification for government forms
- Field assistance capabilities

## Installation

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" with the toggle in the top-right corner
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `fresh_implementation` directory
4. The extension should now be installed and active

## Usage

1. Navigate to a business registration form (like a state's LLC formation website)
2. The extension icon will display a checkmark if a form is detected
3. Click the extension icon to open the popup
4. View detection status, state, and confidence score
5. Use "Get Field Descriptions" to get help with form fields

## Files Overview

- `manifest.json`: Extension configuration with minimal required permissions
- `content.js`: Handles form detection and page analysis
- `background.js`: Manages state and communication between components
- `popup.html`: Simple UI for displaying detection results
- `popup.js`: Logic for the popup interface

## Icons

You will need to add icon files to the `icons` directory:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Implementation Notes

This implementation prioritizes:

1. **Simplicity**: Minimalist code focused on core functionality
2. **Reliability**: Error handling and fallbacks for better stability
3. **Performance**: Lightweight detection algorithms
4. **Security**: Minimal permissions and no CSP restrictions

## Adding Icons

Since this is a clean implementation, you'll need to add your icon files to the `icons` directory before loading the extension. You can copy them from your original extension or create new ones.
