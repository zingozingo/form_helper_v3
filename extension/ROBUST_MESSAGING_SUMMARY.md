# Robust Messaging Implementation

## Problem
The content script fails with "Extension context not available" when:
- Extension is reloaded during development
- Chrome invalidates the extension context
- Background script becomes unavailable
- Message ports are closed

## Solution: content_robust.js

### 1. **Connection State Management**
```javascript
const ConnectionState = {
  CONNECTED: 'connected',
  DISCONNECTED: 'disconnected', 
  INVALIDATED: 'invalidated',
  RETRYING: 'retrying'
};
```

- Tracks connection health continuously
- Validates extension context before sending messages
- Detects when context becomes invalid
- Implements connection recovery

### 2. **Context Validation**
- Multiple checks for chrome.runtime availability
- Safe access to chrome.runtime.id
- Catches exceptions when context is invalid
- Prevents crashes from accessing undefined APIs

### 3. **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**
- 3 retry attempts by default
- Delays: 1s, 2s, 4s between attempts
- Skips retries for permanent failures
- Queues messages for later delivery

### 4. **Local Storage for Offline Operation**
- Saves detection results to sessionStorage
- Loads cached results when offline
- 5-minute cache validity
- Operates independently when disconnected

### 5. **Message Queue System**
- Queues failed messages automatically
- Processes queue when connection restored
- Expires old messages (> 5 minutes)
- Prevents message loss during disconnection

### 6. **Graceful Degradation**
When connection fails:
- Detection continues to work locally
- Results are cached in sessionStorage
- UI shows data from local cache
- Messages queued for later sending

### Key Features:

1. **Automatic Recovery**
   - Periodic connection health checks (30s)
   - Automatic reconnection attempts
   - Queue processing when reconnected

2. **Offline Mode**
   - Full field detection works offline
   - Results stored locally
   - Panel can display cached data
   - No user-facing errors

3. **Smart Error Handling**
   - Different handling for temporary vs permanent errors
   - No retry for "context invalidated" errors
   - Clear logging for debugging

4. **Performance Optimized**
   - Connection checks throttled (5s minimum)
   - Efficient queue processing
   - Minimal overhead when connected

## Testing

1. **Test Context Invalidation**:
   - Load extension and open panel
   - Reload extension from chrome://extensions
   - Panel should show offline mode warning
   - Field detection should still work

2. **Test Recovery**:
   - After reloading, refresh the page
   - Extension should reconnect automatically
   - Queued messages should be sent

3. **Check Console**:
   - Look for "[BRA] Extension context invalidated"
   - Should see "Operating in offline mode"
   - No crashes or unhandled errors

## Benefits

- ✅ No more "Extension context not available" crashes
- ✅ Field detection works even when disconnected
- ✅ Automatic recovery when connection restored
- ✅ User experience maintained during development
- ✅ Graceful handling of all edge cases
