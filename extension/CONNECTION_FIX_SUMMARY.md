# Connection Error Fix Summary

## Issue
"Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist." error in background.js was preventing detection results from reaching the sidebar panel.

## Root Cause
The background script was trying to send messages without checking if there was a receiver (panel) listening. This happens when:
1. The panel is closed
2. The content script hasn't loaded yet
3. Trying to message system pages (chrome://)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Background Script (`background.js`)
- Added error callback to `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` when notifying panels
- Made the error non-fatal (just log it) since panel might be closed
- Added proper error handling to all message sending

### 2. Field Detector (`fieldDetector.js`)
- Wrapped `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` in try-catch
- Added error callback to handle cases where background isn't ready

### 3. Message Flow
The detection flow now works as follows:
1. Content script runs field detection
2. Field detector sends `fieldDetectionUpdate` to background
3. Background stores the result and tries to notify panel
4. If panel is open, it receives the update
5. If panel is closed, error is logged but doesn't break anything

## Key Changes

```javascript
// Before - would throw error if no receiver
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
  action: 'detectionUpdated',
  tabId: tabId,
  result: detectionResults[tabId]
});

// After - handles missing receiver gracefully
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
  action: 'detectionUpdated',
  tabId: tabId,
  result: detectionResults[tabId]
}, function(response) {
  if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
    console.log('[BRA Background] No panel listening (this is normal)');
  }
});
```

## Testing
1. Reload the extension
2. Open the DC business registration page
3. Open the extension panel
4. Should see "DC • 60%" in the header
5. Check console - errors should be logged but not thrown

## Result
- Detection results can now flow properly from content → background → panel
- Missing receivers are handled gracefully
- The panel should now display the detection confidence
