# Static Import Fix Summary

## Problem
The extension was failing because it tried to use `chrome.runtime.getURL()` with dynamic `import()` statements in the content script. This approach fails when:
- The chrome runtime API isn't fully initialized
- Content Security Policy blocks dynamic imports
- The extension context becomes invalid

## Solution
Created a single, self-contained content script (`content_final.js`) with all functionality inlined:

### Key Changes:

1. **Removed ALL dynamic imports** - No more `import()` or `chrome.runtime.getURL()`
2. **Inlined ContentMessaging class** - Full messaging functionality built into the script
3. **Inlined URLDetector** - URL analysis directly in the content script
4. **Inlined FieldDetector** - Field detection logic included
5. **Updated panel.js** - Removed dynamic imports, inlined messaging utilities

### Benefits:

- ✅ No dependency on runtime URL resolution
- ✅ Works even if chrome.runtime is partially available
- ✅ No module loading failures
- ✅ Faster initialization (no async loading)
- ✅ More reliable in restricted environments
- ✅ Single file is easier to debug

### File Structure:

- `content_final.js` - The main content script with everything inlined
- `manifest.json` - Updated to use content_final.js
- `panel.js` - Updated with inline messaging utilities

### Removed Dependencies:
- No longer needs content_messaging.js as separate file
- No longer needs messaging_safe.js for content script
- No longer needs dynamic module loading

The extension should now work reliably without any "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors related to chrome.runtime.getURL().
