# Smart Form Detection Summary

## Problems Fixed

1. **Radio button groups** were split into individual options
2. **Visual sections** were not detected properly
3. **Fields classified as "other"** instead of meaningful categories
4. **No grouping by proximity** or visual hierarchy

## New Smart Detection Features

### 1. **Section Detection**
- Finds actual heading elements (h1-h6, legend, etc.)
- Detects which fields belong under each heading
- Maintains visual hierarchy users see on page
- Skips page-level headers that aren't section titles

### 2. **Radio Button Grouping**
- Groups all radio buttons with same `name` attribute
- Finds group label from:
  - Fieldset legend
  - Preceding heading/label
  - aria-labelledby
  - Common parent container
- Shows as single field with multiple options

### 3. **Smart Field Classification**
Properly categorizes fields based on label/name patterns:

- **Business fields**: organization type, business name, DBA
- **Tax/ID fields**: EIN, state tax ID, SSN
- **Contact fields**: email, phone, fax
- **Address fields**: street, city, state, ZIP, county
- **People fields**: owner info, first/last name
- **Business details**: NAICS code, purpose, employee count
- **Field types**: date, selection, boolean, agreement

### 4. **Label Detection Strategies**
Tries multiple methods in order:
1. aria-label attribute
2. Label with for="id" attribute
3. Parent label element
4. Adjacent text nodes
5. Placeholder text
6. Field name (formatted)

### 5. **Visual Grouping**
- Groups fields by their position under section headers
- Maintains order based on visual layout
- Handles orphaned fields in separate section
- Respects fieldset boundaries

## Example Output

Instead of:
```
○ Yes (other)
○ No (other)
Organization Type (other)
```

Now shows:
```
Section: Business Information
- Organization Type (entity_type) [Radio group with 5 options]
- Business Name (business_name)
- EIN (ein)
```

## Benefits

- ✅ Radio buttons properly grouped as single fields
- ✅ Meaningful field categories instead of "other"
- ✅ Visual sections preserved in detection
- ✅ Better label detection for all field types
- ✅ Smarter classification based on context

## Testing

1. Check console for:
   - `[BRA] Found X section headers`
   - `[BRA] Processing section: "Section Name"`
   - `[BRA] Found radio group "name" with Y options`
   - `[BRA] Found field: "Label" (category)`

2. In panel, verify:
   - Fields grouped under section headers
   - Radio groups show as single items
   - Categories are meaningful (not "other")
   - Field order matches visual layout
