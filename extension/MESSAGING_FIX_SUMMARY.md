# Messaging System Fix Summary

## Problem
The extension was experiencing "The message port closed before a response was received" errors, causing communication failures between content scripts, background script, and panel.

## Solution
Implemented a robust messaging system with the following components:

### 1. **content_messaging.js** - Core messaging handler for content scripts
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff (up to 2 retries)
- Timeout handling (5 second default)
- Message tracking with unique IDs
- Connection health monitoring
- Proper async/await support
- Error recovery and fallback responses

### 2. **content_v2.js** - New content script with robust messaging
- Uses ContentMessaging class for all communication
- Registers handlers for all message types
- Implements proper async message handling
- Includes timeout protection for detection
- Better error reporting

### 3. **content.js** - Wrapper with fallback support
- Tries to load content_v2.js dynamically
- Falls back to minimal implementation if v2 fails
- Ensures basic functionality even in error states
- Reports fallback mode to background/panel

### 4. **Updated background.js**
- Added async wrapper for message handler
- Better error handling with try/catch
- Always sends responses to prevent port closing
- Returns success status in all responses

### 5. **Updated panel.js**
- Uses safe messaging wrapper (panel_messaging.js)
- Handles fallback mode gracefully
- Better error messages for users
- Async/await for cleaner code

## Key Features

1. **Retry Logic**: Messages are retried up to 2 times with exponential backoff
2. **Timeout Protection**: 5-second timeout prevents hanging
3. **Connection Monitoring**: Regular health checks ensure connection is alive
4. **Fallback Mode**: Basic functionality maintained even when full system fails
5. **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation instead of crashes
6. **Message Tracking**: Unique IDs prevent response confusion

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Install the updated extension
2. Open a government website
3. Open the side panel
4. Navigate between pages
5. Check console for any "message port closed" errors

The system should now handle disconnections gracefully without showing errors to users.
