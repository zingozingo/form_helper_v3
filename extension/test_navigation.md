# Testing Navigation Detection Updates

## Test Cases for Chrome Extension

### Issue 1: Detection not updating when navigating within the same government website

1. **Test Single-Page Application Navigation**
   - Navigate to mytax.dc.gov
   - Click through different form pages (e.g., /#1 to /#2)
   - Expected: Detection should update immediately when URL changes
   - Status indicator should show "Detecting..." briefly then update

2. **Test Hash Navigation**
   - Navigate to a government form with hash-based navigation
   - Click links that change the hash (e.g., #step1 to #step2)
   - Expected: New detection triggered automatically

3. **Test History Navigation**
   - Navigate between form pages using browser back/forward buttons
   - Expected: Detection should refresh for each page

4. **Test Programmatic Navigation**
   - Sites that use JavaScript to change URLs without page reload
   - Expected: Detection should still trigger

### Issue 2: Background.js connection errors

1. **Test Valid Tab Communication**
   - Open extension on a government website
   - Check console for connection errors
   - Expected: No "Could not establish connection" errors

2. **Test Invalid Tab Handling**
   - Open extension on non-government sites
   - Expected: No connection errors, graceful handling

3. **Test Tab Switching**
   - Switch between tabs with and without content scripts
   - Expected: No errors, proper detection updates

## Implementation Changes

### Content Script (content.js)
- Added URL change detection with multiple methods:
  - `hashchange` event listener
  - `popstate` event listener  
  - Override of `history.pushState` and `history.replaceState`
  - MutationObserver as fallback
- Reset detection state on URL change
- Send notification to background script

### Background Script (background.js)
- Added URL validation before sending messages
- Check tab exists and has valid URL
- Only ping tabs that are known to be connected
- Proper error handling without logging expected errors
- Handle `urlChanged` messages from content script

### Panel Script (panel.js)
- Handle `urlChanged` notifications
- Clear detection data and show "Detecting..." 
- Trigger new detection after URL change

## How the Fix Works

1. When URL changes within same domain:
   - Content script detects change immediately
   - Resets its detection state
   - Notifies background and panel
   - Triggers new detection automatically

2. For connection errors:
   - Background validates tab before messaging
   - Only attempts to message valid tabs
   - Silently handles expected errors
   - No spam in console for closed panels

The detection should now update instantly when navigating between different form pages on the same government site!
