# Field Detection Test Guide

## Problem
The extension shows "DC • 70%" indicating form detection works, but displays "No business fields detected yet" even when form fields are present.

## Solution Implemented
Created `content_enhanced.js` with a complete field detection system that:

1. **Comprehensive Field Scanning**
   - Finds all input, select, and textarea elements
   - Handles both forms and orphaned fields
   - Groups radio buttons and checkboxes
   - Skips hidden and non-visible elements

2. **Enhanced Label Detection**
   - Checks aria-label and aria-labelledby
   - Finds associated labels via for attribute
   - Checks parent label elements
   - Finds nearby text
   - Uses placeholder as fallback
   - Converts field names to readable format

3. **Improved Field Classification**
   - Business name variations
   - EIN/Tax ID fields
   - Address components
   - Contact information
   - Entity type selections
   - Owner/principal information
   - All standard form fields

4. **Field Organization**
   - Groups fields into visual sections
   - Organizes by category
   - Sorts by position on page
   - Provides UI-friendly data structure

## Testing Steps

1. **Check Console Output**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Look for messages starting with [BRA]
   - Should see:
     - "[BRA FieldDetector] Starting field detection"
     - "[BRA FieldDetector] Found X forms"
     - "[BRA FieldDetector] Scanning Y elements"
     - "[BRA FieldDetector] Found field: [label] (category)"
     - "[BRA FieldDetector] Detection complete. Found Z fields"

2. **Verify Panel Display**
   - Fields should appear under "Fields Detected"
   - Each field shows:
     - Label text
     - Field category/type
   - Fields grouped by section if applicable

3. **Debug Commands**
   In the console, you can run:
   ```javascript
   // Force detection
   chrome.runtime.sendMessage({action: 'triggerDetection'})
   
   // Check current result
   chrome.runtime.sendMessage({action: 'getDetectionResult'}, console.log)
   ```

## What to Expect

When working properly:
- Form detection shows state and percentage (e.g., "DC • 70%")
- Fields section lists all detected fields with their types
- Fields are organized logically
- Common business fields are properly classified

## Troubleshooting

If fields still don't show:
1. Check if content_enhanced.js is loaded (check Sources tab)
2. Look for errors in console
3. Verify the page has actual form fields
4. Try refreshing the page
5. Reopen the side panel
