# Business Registration Assistant Extension Fixes

## Changes Made

1. **Removed problematic CSP settings in manifest.json**
   - Created `manifest_fixed.json` with the CSP directive removed
   - The restrictive CSP was likely causing script execution problems

2. **Using simplified versions of scripts**
   - The extension already had simplified versions of the background and content scripts
   - These simplified versions maintain core functionality while reducing complexity
   - `content_simplified.js` maintains all essential form detection functions
   - `background_simplified.js` provides the necessary messaging and state management

## Instructions to Implement Fixes

1. Replace the current `manifest.json` with the fixed version:
   ```
   mv manifest_fixed.json manifest.json
   ```

2. Use the simplified script versions:
   ```
   # Update content script reference in manifest.json (already done in fixed manifest)
   # Make sure it points to content_simplified.js instead of content.js
   
   # Update background script reference in manifest.json (already done in fixed manifest)
   # Make sure it points to background_simplified.js instead of background.js
   ```

3. Test the extension:
   - Load the extension in Chrome using Developer Mode
   - Navigate to a DC government business registration form
   - Verify that form detection works and the popup shows "Business form detected" with confidence score

## Why These Changes Work

1. **CSP Removal**:
   - The restrictive Content Security Policy was likely blocking necessary script execution
   - Manifest V3's default CSP is generally secure enough for most extensions
   - Removing the custom CSP allows all extension scripts to run properly

2. **Simplified Scripts**:
   - The simplified versions maintain core functionality while removing potential issues
   - The form detection algorithm in `content_simplified.js` is the same as in the original
   - Communication between components is streamlined in the simplified versions
   - Error handling is improved in the simplified scripts

## Testing Criteria

The extension should be considered fixed when:

1. The popup shows "Business form detected" when on a DC government business registration form
2. The confidence score is displayed correctly
3. The state is identified correctly (when applicable)
4. No console errors appear during normal operation

## Future Improvements

Once basic functionality is restored, consider:

1. Fine-tuning the form detection algorithm for better accuracy
2. Implementing the auto-fill functionality
3. Adding field-specific help features
4. Implementing state-specific requirements guides
