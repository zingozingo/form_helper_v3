2. **Robustness**: Adding comprehensive error handling throughout
3. **Security**: Ensuring all code follows best practices for extensions
4. **Performance**: Minimizing DOM operations and page impact
5. **Maintainability**: Structuring code for easier understanding and future updates

## Testing Approach

The extension was tested with attention to:

1. **Form Detection**: Verifying accurate detection of business registration forms
2. **UI Injection**: Ensuring proper display of button and sidebar
3. **Message Passing**: Confirming reliable communication between components
4. **Error Handling**: Testing recovery from error conditions
